How To Use This Program:

Run the Jar file:
Follow the given instruction:
R will generate a random board of size AxB, display it and the answer the solver produced
F will read in the file picross5x5.csv and solve it
T will read in the file picross10x10.csv and solve it

Very little input handling is in place so precise entries are needed (ie. R not r)
If there are any problems please contact us.

(I haven't handled reading in files in combination with Jars so I'm not sure
precicely where the txt files need to be, I'd assume same folder)
